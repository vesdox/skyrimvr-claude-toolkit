# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added project-aware bounded deployment with exact project/environment/target/set
  registration, build-proven and hash-pinned native artifacts, dry-run destination
  inspection, and a two-phase constrained Windows bridge with backups, race checks,
  resulting-hash verification, and rollback. Hoarfrost is initially authorized only
  for `Hoarfrost - Development` in ASSOS; load order, mod enablement, game launch,
  saves, and runtime configuration remain outside the capability.

## v3.5.4 — 2026-08-07

Two community-reported fixes, both verified independently here before merging.

### Fixed

- **Portable MO2 instances (Nolvus / Wabbajack layouts) were never detected.** Reported and fixed by
  [@Leit-motif](https://github.com/Leit-motif) (#5). On a portable instance, detection fell through
  to the stock/Vortex branch and wrote `Documents\My Games\...` plus `%LOCALAPPDATA%\...` for the INI
  and load-order paths — paths that exist but that no MO2 profile uses. Confidently wrong, which is
  precisely the failure MO2 support was added to prevent. Three independent causes, each of which
  alone was enough to break it:
  - `ini_get` didn't unwrap QSettings' `@ByteArray(...)` form, which MO2 writes routinely for
    `gamePath` and `selected_profile`. **This also broke the `MO2_INSTANCE_INI` escape hatch that
    v3.4 documented for portable instances** — so the documented workaround didn't work either.
  - Only global instances under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ModOrganizer\` were probed. Nolvus/Wabbajack park the
    portable instance beside the game folder, so the game root's siblings are now probed too.
  - The sibling probe resolves through `..`, which would have written an unreadable
    `STOCK GAME/../MO2` instance path into `CLAUDE.md`. Normalized with `pwd -W`.

  Verified by rebuilding the reported layout and running the real `setup.sh` against it: portable
  instance detected with correct profile/mods/overwrite paths; a decoy sibling instance pointing at a
  *different* game correctly ignored (the `gamePath` equality gate holds); global instances with
  plain non-`@ByteArray` values still detected; non-MO2 installs still take the stock branch.

- **PyFFI does not need a dedicated Python 3.10 install.** Reported and fixed by
  [@awesmdiver](https://github.com/awesmdiver) (#4). Every mention of PyFFI told you to install a
  separate 3.10 to avoid breaking on 3.12+. That extra install is unnecessary: PyFFI 2.2.3's only
  version blocker is a single `from distutils.cmd import Command` in `pyffi/utils/__init__.py`, used
  by an unused doc-building helper, and `distutils` left the stdlib in 3.12 (PEP 632).
  `pip install pyffi setuptools` resolves it — setuptools vendors its own `distutils` plus an import
  shim, the sanctioned PEP 632 migration path.

  Verified here on 3.12 (the reporter verified 3.14.6, which between them brackets the range that
  matters): reproduced the failure on a bare venv, confirmed the shim resolves through
  `setuptools/_distutils`, then read → mutated → wrote → re-read a real game NIF successfully. The
  separate `time.clock` monkey-patch is unrelated (removed in 3.8) and still required.

  Worth knowing *why* this became common: **since Python 3.12, `venv` no longer installs setuptools
  by default** — a fresh 3.12 venv ships pip only. The breakage is a newly-missing dependency, not a
  newly-broken library.

## v3.5.3 — 2026-07-31

### Changed

- **Promoted the "don't hand-install a mod into `Data/`" rule from `KNOWLEDGEBASE.md` into
  `CLAUDE.md`'s Safety Rules.** v3.5.2 removed the bad instruction from the setup prompt and wrote up
  the reasoning in the knowledgebase — but the knowledgebase is *consulted*, while `CLAUDE.md` is
  *always loaded*. A rule whose whole job is to stop an action at the moment you're about to take it
  is useless in a file you have to remember to open. The KB entry stays as the long-form explanation;
  the Safety Rules now carry the rule itself.
- Scoped precisely: it covers installing **someone else's** packaged mod (SKSE plugin DLLs included).
  Writing your own in-development mod's files into `Data/` is normal work and explicitly unaffected.

## v3.5.2 — 2026-07-31

### Changed

- **The setup prompt no longer offers to install DevBench.** It listed DevBench alongside the
  `tools/` utilities and instructed Claude to "install it to `Data/SKSE/Plugins/devbench.dll`" — but
  DevBench is the one optional item that isn't a dev tool. Everything else installs under `tools/`
  and never touches the game; DevBench is an **SKSE plugin**, i.e. a mod. Hand-copying a DLL into
  `Data/` bypasses Vortex/MO2, leaves the file untracked, and on a managed install a later deploy or
  purge can clobber it — the opposite of what the rest of this toolkit's safety design stands for.
  The prompt now *tells* the user DevBench exists and what it unlocks, and says explicitly that it's
  a mod they install through their own mod manager, and that Claude must not copy files into `Data/`
  itself. The bundled `tools/devbench-cli.sh` wrapper works the moment DevBench is present.
- The same correction applied to `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `setup.sh`'s closing tool summary,
  which all carried the "download it into `Data/SKSE/Plugins/devbench.dll`" phrasing.
- All three copies of the setup prompt (`SETUP_PROMPT.txt`, `README.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`)
  remain byte-identical, now verified programmatically rather than by eye.

### Docs

- `KNOWLEDGEBASE.md`: new "Never hand-install a mod into `Data/` on a managed install" note under Mod
  Manager Layout — why a dev tool and a mod aren't the same thing, and what hand-placing a file
  actually breaks under Vortex vs MO2.

## v3.5.1 — 2026-07-31

Tracks DevBench **1.12.0** upstream. The liveness check the toolkit shipped in v3.3 was the best
available at the time; DevBench has since added a purpose-built endpoint that does the job properly,
and the old approach has a hole worth naming.

### Fixed

- **`devbench-cli.sh alive` could not detect the thing it existed to detect.** It diffed the `frame`
  counter across two `inspect {kind:state}` calls — but *every* DevBench tool call is dispatched onto
  the game's **main thread** and throws 504 after 5 s if that thread is stuck. So on a genuine hang
  the probe itself hung: you got a timeout indistinguishable from a closed game, precisely when you
  needed a diagnosis. It now uses **`GET /api/health`** (DevBench 1.11.0+, answered *off* the main
  thread since 1.12.0), the one endpoint that keeps replying through a stall.
- **A frozen frame was reported as "paused or hung" — one verdict for two very different problems.**
  `alive` now separates four states using `pendingTasks`/`lastTaskFrame` as the discriminator:
  running (0) · paused/console-open/loading, queue draining normally (2) · genuinely **hung**, tasks
  queued but not completing (2) · server up but **no save loaded**, `frame < 0` (3). A frozen frame
  alone is not evidence of a hang; the old check cried wolf every time you opened a menu.
- **HTTP status was ignored — any JSON body counted as success.** A `504` (main thread busy) or a
  `400` (bad argument type; 1.11.0 reclassified these from 500) was printed as if the call had
  worked. Each now reports what actually went wrong and returns a distinct exit code, so a busy game,
  a malformed call, and a closed game stop looking identical.
- `jget`'s jq path used `// empty`, which swallowed a legitimate `false` — `vr` on an SE install read
  as missing rather than false.

### New

- **`devbench-cli.sh health`** — the raw off-thread probe: `{ ok, lastLifecycle, frame,
  lastTaskFrame, pendingTasks, pid, port, exe, vr }`.
- **Instance identity in `alive` output** (`pid`/`exe`/`vr`/`port`). If you have both SE and VR open,
  a client pinned to the wrong port returns real-looking results from the wrong game; this surfaces
  the misattach in one call. MCP clients get the same signal via `inspect kind=health`.

### Compatibility

- **Older DevBench still works.** On a build without `/api/health` (pre-1.11.0) the wrapper detects
  the 404, falls back to the legacy frame diff, and says so on stderr rather than failing.
- Every path above was exercised against a mock server reproducing each scenario — running, paused,
  hung, not-in-game, legacy-404, 504, 400, and a dead port — with and without `jq` on PATH.

### Docs

- `KNOWLEDGEBASE.md`'s "liveness ≠ ping" entry rewrote its now-outdated advice (the two-read frame
  diff) into the four-state table, plus the status-code semantics.
- The `game save` deadlock entry notes that `health` — not `inspect` — is how you watch for it.
- **`README.md`'s copy of the setup prompt was stale** — it never mentioned DevBench, so anyone who
  pasted the prompt from the README (the most visible copy, and the one the Nexus page points at)
  was never offered DevBench during setup. It is now byte-identical to the canonical
  `SETUP_PROMPT.txt`, which `docs/getting-started.md` already matched.

## v3.5 — 2026-07-31

### New Capabilities

- **Optional devcontainer** for the tools that don't need Windows or an active MO2 session:
  Spriggit ESP inspection/diffing, FOMOD/JSON generation, unit-testing mod logic, ReSaver CLI.
  Credit: this originated in [@aaronputty](https://github.com/aaronputty)'s fork of this toolkit
  ([putty-skyrim-claude-toolkit](https://github.com/aaronputty/putty-skyrim-claude-toolkit)), who
  gave the go-ahead to bring it upstream after they weren't able to get back to their own 9-commits-
  ahead branch. Not copied verbatim — rebuilt and re-verified for this toolkit's shape, credited
  throughout.

  - `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`: Python 3.11 + Node 20 + .NET 9 + JDK 17 (ReSaver's floor), on Debian
    **bookworm** rather than the source fork's bullseye (bullseye's LTS window ends 2026-08-31;
    bookworm also means JDK installs as a plain `apt-get` instead of a manual fetch). Build and every
    toolchain component verified inside a real container: Python 3.11.15, Node 20.20.2, JDK 17.0.20,
    .NET SDK 9.0.316, and `dotnet tool restore` successfully restoring `spriggit.cli`.
  - `devshell-docker.sh` / `devshell.sh`: build-and-shell wrappers (Docker-only, or via the
    `@devcontainers/cli`). `devshell-docker.sh` reads its mount sources straight out of
    `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` rather than hardcoding them, so it can't drift from what
    `setup.sh` resolved.
  - **`setup.sh` now also fills in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`'s mount paths** — from the
    detected MO2 instance's mods/profile/overwrite folders on an MO2 install, or from `Data/` and the
    INI config folder on stock/Vortex. Verified end-to-end: the real `devshell-docker.sh` (not a
    manual reconstruction) building the image, mounting a real game `Data/` folder read-only,
    restoring `dotnet` tools, and — checked directly via `docker inspect` and a live write
    attempt — enforcing that read-only mount (`touch` on the mounted path fails with "Read-only file
    system").
  - **`examples/inspect-esp.py`** verified against a real third-party mod plugin with actual records
    (correctly listed its MagicEffects/Quests/Spells groups). The source fork's version imported a
    Python `esplugin` package that doesn't exist on PyPI (esplugin is a Rust crate) and would have
    failed on line one — rewritten to use only the Spriggit path, which is what actually works, and
    corrected to this toolkit's own Spriggit convention (`Spriggit.Yaml` + a required
    `--PackageVersion`, not `Spriggit.Yaml.Skyrim` with no version).
  - **One confirmed limitation, found while verifying:** a plugin using localized strings (the
    `Localized` flag — common in vanilla ESMs) fails to serialize via Spriggit inside the container
    with a Mutagen exception, because its BSA/load-order resolution has no default path on Linux.
    Documented in `docs/container-vs-windows.md` rather than silently shipped as if it worked
    universally.
  - Toolchain pins: `package.json`, `requirements.txt` (container-side Python deps),
    `requirements-windows.txt` (Windows-only, e.g. `pywin32` — doesn't build on Linux),
    `.config/dotnet-tools.json` (Spriggit CLI), `.node-version`, `.python-version`.
  - **A real bug caught and fixed during verification, not shipped:** `devshell-docker.sh`'s `jq`
    calls and its `docker run` mount targets all reference bare `/skyrim/...`-style paths — under Git
    Bash on Windows, any such bare-slash argument gets silently rewritten to a Windows path
    (`/skyrim/mods` → `C:/Program Files/Git/skyrim/mods`) before reaching `jq` or `docker.exe`. Fixed
    with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` and resolving `SCRIPT_DIR` via `pwd -W`. Also fixed: `jq` can't parse
    the JSONC `//` comments that VS Code and the devcontainer CLI both allow in `devcontainer.json` —
    `devshell-docker.sh` now strips whole-line comments before parsing.

- **`docs/container-vs-windows.md`** — the tool-routing decision table (container vs. Windows vs.
  MO2's executables list), adapted from the source fork and cross-referenced with this toolkit's own
  MO2 documentation.

- **`docs/skse-cross-compile.md`** — the source fork's SKSE-plugin cross-compilation recipe
  (LLVM/xwin/xmake), documented as an opt-in addendum rather than built into the default image. It
  roughly doubles the container (LLVM 17 + a ~700MB Windows SDK/CRT splat) for a capability the
  source author themselves called unvalidated beyond one experiment (a pre-pivot build of the SKSE
  plugin Mora) — kept out of the default so that cost doesn't land on every user's container build.

## v3.4 — 2026-07-27

### New Capabilities

- **Mod Organizer 2 support.** Previous versions assumed the Vortex/stock layout, where mods deploy
  into the game's `Data/`. **MO2 has no real merged `Data/` folder** — it builds a virtual one at
  launch by overlaying the stock game, each enabled mod's own folder, and `overwrite/`. So on an MO2
  setup the toolkit was pointing Claude at a real-but-nearly-empty `Data/`, and at Documents and
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%` for INIs and load order that actually live in the MO2 profile.

  `setup.sh` now detects MO2 (global instances under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ModOrganizer/<name>/`, or a
  portable instance via `MO2_INSTANCE_INI`), matches an instance to this game folder by its
  `gamePath`, resolves `selected_profile` and the real mods / overwrite / profiles directories
  (including `base_directory` overrides and the `%BASE_DIR%` token), and writes those paths into
  `CLAUDE.md` — moving the INI and load-order paths to the profile when the files are genuinely
  there. Non-MO2 installs are unaffected and get a short stock-layout note instead.

- **The MO2 silent-wrong-answer trap is now documented** in `KNOWLEDGEBASE.md` and injected into
  CLAUDE.md for MO2 users: xelib/XEditLib resolves plugins from the game path, so launched *outside*
  MO2 it sees only the plugins physically in the stock `Data/`. It doesn't error — it returns a wrong
  but plausible answer for anything involving the override chain or full load order. Run those through
  MO2's executables list; single-plugin work (Spriggit by path) is fine outside MO2 because it never
  consults the load order.

- **`AGENTS.md`** — the toolkit now ships the cross-agent convention file, so agents that look for it
  find their way in. It points at `CLAUDE.md` rather than duplicating it (so they can't drift), and is
  explicit about what is portable (the knowledgebase and every tool — plain bash/Node/Python) versus
  what is Claude Code specific (the safety hooks and skills), with concrete compensating practices for
  agents that don't get the guardrails.

### Knowledgebase

Six additions, kept deliberately to things any Skyrim modder hits regardless of what they're building:

- **Mod manager layout** — the MO2 virtual filesystem, where each thing really lives, and the
  load-order tooling trap.
- **A recompiled `.pex` only loads at game startup** — a mid-session save/load never re-reads it, not
  even from a save that has never seen your mod. The only reliable refresh is a full restart onto a
  *pre-activation* save. Includes the design implication: make anything you intend to tune a runtime
  parameter, so iterating never touches the code.
- **xelib `setFormID` master-count high-byte trap** — a bare local FormID sets the high byte to `0x00`,
  which the engine reads as an override of a `Skyrim.esm` record. Silently corrupt, and it half-works
  often enough to be expensive to find.
- **Reused vanilla records can carry gating Conditions** — the usual cause of a vanilla effect that
  fires on some targets but not others.
- **CrashLogger writes `.LOG`, not `.txt`** — why your crash logs appear to be missing.
- **AutoMod BSA extract/repack needs `bsarch.exe`**, and it lives under `bin/`, so any rebuild wipes it.
- **Explosion knockback needs a Knock Down flag** — `DATA\Force` moves nobody without it, no matter how
  high you raise it.

### Docs

- `docs/getting-started.md` gains a "What's in `tools/`" reference table naming every bundled script.

---

## v3.3 — 2026-07-27

### New Capabilities

- **DevBench — the live in-game test channel.** The toolkit's tools all shortened the time to *make*
  a change; this one attacks the loop that actually costs you evenings — change, launch, trigger,
  "still broken", guess again. With [DevBench](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/181326)
  (alandtse) installed, Claude drives the **running** game itself: reads live state (Papyrus VM health,
  active effects, inventory, quests, the loaded ref grid), runs console commands **and reads their
  output**, calls Papyrus functions **and gets the return value back**, narrates tests on your HUD while
  you're in the headset, dismisses modals, and runs scripted scenarios with real event waits instead of
  guessed sleeps. Tuning a value stops being an edit→recompile→reload→ask-you-to-try cycle and becomes
  another call into the live game.

  **DevBench is NOT bundled** (GPL-3.0-or-later) — install it from Nexus mod 181326 into
  `Data/SKSE/Plugins/devbench.dll`. It is dev-only: no gameplay change, no save data. The toolkit ships
  the wrapper and the knowledge:
  - **`tools/devbench-cli.sh`** — resolves the port automatically (reads DevBench's `runtime.json`,
    else the per-runtime default: VR `8921`, SE/AE `8920`; override with `DEVBENCH_PORT`), and wraps
    the common operations: `ping`, `alive`, `state`, `inspect <kind>`, `exec "<console cmd>"` (handles
    the two-step capture/read fence), `call <Script> <Function> [args] [self]`, `describe`, `notify`
    (HUD narration), plus a raw `tool` escape hatch for any tool and any JSON. Fails fast with a clear
    message when the game isn't running.
  - **`alive`** encodes the single most important hazard: DevBench's HTTP server runs on a **separate
    thread from the game**, so a hung or deadlocked game still answers `ping`. Real liveness is whether
    the `frame` counter advances between two reads — `alive` checks exactly that and exits 2 on a stuck
    frame.
  - **A new KNOWLEDGEBASE section** covering the hazards learned the hard way on a 700+ plugin VR load
    order: the `game save` deadlock, what does and doesn't work while the game is paused (reads yes,
    writes no, shader probes give false negatives), why heavy console commands like `smp reset` can CTD
    a big load order, why you spawn test actors instead of poking the player's live state, the Papyrus
    `call` gotchas (omitted trailing optionals are padded to neutral defaults, silently no-opping
    `MoveTo`/`Disable`/`Kill`), and the protocol for tests a VR user must physically observe.

### Docs

- README, CLAUDE.md, `setup.sh`, `SETUP_PROMPT.txt`, and `docs/getting-started.md` all cover DevBench
  as an optional tool, and it's credited to alandtse.

## v3.2.1 — 2026-07-26

Hotfix release. `setup.sh` only — no tool or knowledgebase changes. If you installed v3.1 or v3.2,
re-run `bash setup.sh` against a fresh copy of `CLAUDE.md` (or fix the two Key Paths lines by hand);
the paths it wrote for you were wrong.

### Fixes
- **The Load Order path written into CLAUDE.md was corrupted on every Windows install.**
  `$LOCALAPPDATA` is backslash-delimited, and it was fed straight into `sed`'s replacement text,
  where GNU sed treats `\U`, `\a` etc. as escapes — `C:\Users\You\AppData\Local` came out as
  `C:SERSYOUAPPDATAocal`. Both `$LOCALAPPDATA` and the Documents path are now normalized to forward
  slashes before substitution. Affects v3.1 and v3.2. (Fix by @awesmdiver.)
- **SE installs with a redirected Documents folder were detected as VR.** `DOCUMENTS_DIR` was
  hardcoded to `C:/Users/<you>/Documents`, so a Documents folder moved by OneDrive "Back up your
  folders", a manual Properties → Location move, or a GPO redirect matched neither `My Games`
  probe and fell through to the `Skyrim VR` default. Now resolved via
  `[Environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments')`, with the old hardcoded path as fallback.
  (Fix by @awesmdiver.)
- **The game root written into CLAUDE.md was an MSYS path, not a Windows path.** `pwd` under Git
  Bash returns `/c/Games/Skyrim` — a form Claude's file tools and PowerShell can't open. CLAUDE.md
  now gets the `C:/Games/Skyrim` form (`pwd -W`); the script's own filesystem work is unchanged.
- **SE/VR detection ignored the one unambiguous signal.** A fresh install that had never been
  launched has no `My Games/<variant>/` folder yet, so detection fell through to `Skyrim VR` even
  when only `SkyrimSE.exe` was present. The game folder's `.exe` is now the primary signal, with
  the config-folder probe as the tiebreaker.
- Removed a dead `{{USERNAME}}` substitution — no such placeholder exists in the CLAUDE.md template.

---

## v3.2 — 2026-07-09

### Fixes
- **xelib scripts couldn't find the wrapper on a fresh install.** `tools/xelib/loader_diag.js`,
  `tools/xelib/active-plugins.js`, and `tools/resaver-resolve-names.js` used `require('./xelib')`,
  which resolves to a local file that only exists in a dev layout — on a clean install they threw
  `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. All now `require('xeditlib')` (the real package name). Install xeditlib **from
  the toolkit root** (`npm install github:WingedGuardian/xeditlib`) so Node's upward module lookup
  finds it from `tools/` and `examples/` alike; the bundled `XEditLib.dll` + `*.Hardcoded.dat` load
  relative to the package, so the scripts are cwd-independent. Docs/setup updated to say so.
  (Thanks to @awesmdiver for reporting the broken require paths.)

### New Capabilities
- **ReSaver CLI — changeform-level diagnostics.** New read ops `recon` (sync-aware parse-coverage
  scan of all changeform body types), `changeform` (parse one changeform body), `extradata-scan`,
  `changeform-diff`, `globaldata`/`globaldata-diff`, `freeze-report`; new verify-gated write ops
  `reset-havok`, `cleanse-formlists`, `remove-created`, plus a `verify-roundtrip` self-test. Every
  `--apply` is verify-gated (the output is re-read and compared to the written model; on any
  unintended divergence the file is deleted and the op fails). Read/diagnostic ops layer a small
  **analysis overlay** (modified ReSaver source, Apache-2.0 — see
  `tools/resaver-cli/analysis-overlay/NOTICE.md`) in front of your jar for extra parse coverage;
  write ops always run the STOCK jar; if the overlay can't compile against your ReSaver version the
  wrapper falls back to stock parsing automatically. JVM flags are now JDK-version-gated so the tool
  starts on JDK 17–22 (not just 23+).
- **cosave-info** (`tools/cosave-cli.sh` + `tools/cosave-info.py`) — read-only structural survey of
  an SKSE `.skse` co-save → JSON: which mods stashed co-save data (StorageUtil/PapyrusUtil/
  JContainers/per-mod blobs) and how much — the mod-state landscape the `.ess` itself never exposes.

---

## v3.1 — 2026-06-27

### New Capabilities
- **ReSaver CLI** (`tools/resaver-cli.sh`) — headless `.ess` save parsing, querying, cross-referencing,
  and cleaning, driving ReSaver's (FallrimTools) Java library. Ops: `info` / `dump` / `find` /
  `find-refs` / `worries` / `set-global` / `set-var` / `clean`. Writes are dry-run unless `--apply` and
  always go to a NEW file (never overwriting the input); FormID→EditorID resolution via
  `tools/resaver-resolve-names.js`. Supersedes raw binary byte-scanning for structured save work.

### Reliability Fixes
- **AutoMod** — `tools/automod-cli.sh` now invokes the **prebuilt `spookys-automod.dll`** instead of
  `dotnet run`, eliminating the per-call recompile / MSB1025 failures.
- **Spriggit** — `tools/spriggit-cli.sh` runs deep/nested output paths in a shallow workspace,
  fixing the `UnauthorizedAccessException` on deeply-nested paths (preserves the exact basename = ModKey).
- **xelib** — `tools/xelib/active-plugins.js` `loadActive()` handles the case where the SSE `plugins.txt`
  the GM_SSE loader expects is absent on a VR install (which otherwise fails silently).

### Setup Instructions Overhaul
- Every optional tool now has explicit acquisition/build instructions in CLAUDE.md, setup.sh,
  SETUP_PROMPT.txt, and README.md — including the AutoMod clone + Cli-project build (fixes Claude
  treating the AutoMod CLI as "fictional" when it wasn't already present).

---

## v3.0 — 2026-06-23

### New Capabilities
- **Author animated NIFs from scratch (PyNifly)** — self-spinning meshes (a `SpecialIdle`
  NiControllerSequence that auto-loops on a placed Activator with zero scripting), telescoping/
  extending geometry, and transform-keyframed effects. PyNifly writes the controller blocks correctly
  (hand-rolled PyFFI authoring CTDs the engine). It also reads/writes SSE **BSTriShape** meshes, which
  PyFFI cannot.
- **Headless render-verify loop** — `tools/blender-nif-validate.py` (independent PyNifly parse gate) +
  `tools/blender-nif-render.py` (render a NIF to PNG) confirm a mesh/VFX fix in chat before a game
  launch. NifSkope serves as the independent visual gate. "Author → validate → render-proof."
- **NIF geometry surgery** — `tools/pyffi-geometry-split.py` (split one shape into two for independent
  shaders / partial-mesh glow), plus the glow-map / mesh-split / stretch techniques documented in the
  knowledgebase.
- **AutoMod CLI** (`tools/automod-cli.sh`) — NIF / BSA / audio / MCM / ESP modules surfaced as a
  first-class tool.
- **ESP cross-reference integrity guard** — `tools/esp-verify-wrapper.sh` snapshots and diffs every
  record's cross-references (FormID + target master) to catch silent re-mastering / dropped-reference
  corruption from bulk remaps.
- **Snapshot-before-edit hook** — `.claude/hooks/snapshot-before-tool.sh` auto-snapshots active
  `.psc`/`.pex` files before every Bash command (external tools bypass the Edit/Write backup hook),
  with rate limiting and auto-pruning.

### Knowledgebase
- Grown and **fully scrubbed** to ~1,381 lines of generalizable, project-agnostic knowledge.
- New engine sections: Havok game units (≈70:1), the VR melee hit-detection stack + engine melee-range
  cap, spawned-actor Havok CTD (`Is3DLoaded()` guard), no-Papyrus-raycast limit, immobilizing the
  player/NPCs in VR (SetDontMove vs DisablePlayerControls vs EnableAI, with aggro/VRIK interactions),
  the NIF validation/render trichotomy, PyFFI limits & PyNifly authoring, the Music System (MUSC vs
  MUST, ducking-bypass, FNAM flags), SOUN-vs-SNDR wiring, the WAV→XWM pipeline, the Papyrus VM
  page-policy CTD on heavy modlists, and more.

### CLAUDE.md
- New principle sections: Vanilla Game as Frame of Reference, Native Engine Solutions First, Do Your
  Homework (due diligence), and Cognitive Co-Pilot (anticipate, don't just comply).
- New tool docs: PyFFI, PyNifly, AutoMod CLI, the NIF validation/render trichotomy, and the
  esp-verify integrity guard — all version-agnostic.

## v2.0

### New Capabilities
- **ESP editing via Spriggit** — Serialize any ESP to human-readable YAML, edit directly, deserialize back. Now the primary recommended workflow for record editing.
- **AutoMod CLI integration** — NIF mesh inspection and editing, BSA archive CRUD, audio file processing (FUZ/XWM/WAV), and MCM menu generation via SpookyPirate's AutoMod Toolkit.
- **Save file analysis** — New `scripts/read-save.py` + `skyrim-save` skill. Decompress .ess saves, extract the full plugin list, search for orphaned scripts, detect effect accumulation, check mod footprint, and monitor save bloat over time.
- **8 Claude Code skills** — Auto-loading slash commands: `/inspect-esp`, `/port-to-vr`, `/create-mod`. Auto-context for NIFs, BSAs, audio files, save files, and general Skyrim modding context.

### Changes
- Version-agnostic: fully supports SE, AE, VR, and LE. Not VR-exclusive despite VR origins.
- Framing updated to reflect actual strengths: power user tool for porting, debugging, and editing — complex mods from scratch require iteration.
- Setup prompt updated to include AutoMod CLI as an optional install.
- Knowledgebase expanded with save file format documentation.
- README reordered: porting and debugging examples now lead; new-mod-from-scratch examples follow with honest caveats.
